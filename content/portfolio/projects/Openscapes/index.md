## About Openscapes
The Openscapes approach develops open, inclusive practices in environmental and Earth science to help uncover data-intensive solutions faster. Openscapes was created by [Dr. Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/) in 2019 as part of her Mozilla Open Leadership Fellowship. During this time, she created the flagship Champions mentorship program, which helps teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind. I joined Openscapes after the first two cohorts at the end of 2020 and am now the Openscapes co-Director. 

Together, Julie and I have continued to evolve the Champions curriculum and extended the Openscapes approach and created a framework to describe the approach to scale Openscapes beyond the two of us.

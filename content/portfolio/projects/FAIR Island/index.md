## About the FAIR Island Project
The FAIR Island Project translates FAIR Data Principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) and the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Carroll et al., 2020) into practice for scientific field stations through the development of place-based data policies and critical research infrastructure centered on machine-actionable data management plans. The FAIR Island Project is a collaboration between the California Digital Library, UC Berkeley, DataCite, Metadata Game Changers and the Tetiaroa Society.

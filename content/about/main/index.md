  I am a natural connector, passionate about fostering innovation through collaboration. Over the last 20 years, I have created communities and programs with lasting impact around science, data, and technology. <br><br>
  I work at the intersection of community informatics, Earth science and formerly, non-profit management. Over nearly two decades, I have honed an eclectic skillset both technical and managerial, creating communities and programs with lasting impact around science, data, and technology. I am passionate about fostering innovation through collaboration across diverse nodes. <br><br>
  After serving as the Executive Director for the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) from 2014-2020, I co-founded [Metadata Game Changers](https://metadatagamechangers.com/), with co-founder, Dr. Ted Habermann, to champion open science and good data management. In this position, I facilitate collaboration, build communities and coach Open science leaders to expedite progress toward data interoperability.<br><br>
  With my collaborators, I am developing and understanding information infrastructures for Earth and environmental science applications to: (1) support field station researchers with better data management in the [FAIR Island Project](https://www.fairisland.org/) and (2) aide researchers using NASA Earth science data as they move analysis workflows to the Cloud in the [NASA-Openscapes Project](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/). <br><br>
  I am passionate about building and supporting collaborative communities. I received a M.Sc. degree in Environmental Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 2010 and focused on the integration of distributed datasets to characterize long-term transport of smoke and dust. I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Science based on these research activities at University of Colorado, Boulder in the Information Science department.

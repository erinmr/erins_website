      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <guid>https://erinrobinson.info/talk/agu-open-project-design/</guid>
      <description>Julie Lowndes and I presented an invited paper “Open Project Design: Lessons from the NASA Openscapes Framework” virtually at the 2021 American Geophysical Union (AGU) annual conference, in a session “Open Science In Action” convened by Dr. Chelle Gentemann and colleagues.
Abstract: Open source software is about more than code: it’s about welcoming a broadening audience to a shared vision and planning for sustainability. We’ll cover considerations for open project design focused on inclusion, community building, web presence, and technology choices, sharing strategies from the NASA Openscapes Framework as an example.</description>

      <description>Julie Lowndes and I presented an invited talk “Better Science for Future Us” virtually at the 2021 NASEM joint Mapping Sciences Committee and the Geographical Sciences Committee Workshop, Accelerating the Analysis of Geographic Change, in a session “Data interoperability”. We realized in preparing for this talk that while often the focus is on tooling, what Openscapes provides is the connection between tools and people.

      <description>Rendering mathematical equations     Examples from the mathjax demo. But they work with katex as well.
Rmarkdown     In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either
$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\). There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because knitr automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.
And you can use
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ to get a math paragraph:</description>

      <description>About Openscapes     The Openscapes approach develops open, inclusive practices in environmental and Earth science to help uncover data-intensive solutions faster. Openscapes was created by Dr. Julia Stewart Lowndes in 2019 as part of her Mozilla Open Leadership Fellowship. During this time, she created the flagship Champions mentorship program, which helps teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind. I joined Openscapes after the first two cohorts at the end of 2020 and am now the Openscapes co-Director.</description>

Air quality impacts from forest fires, which are increasing in frequency, is one example of large, data-intensive science with societal impacts. Understanding long-range transport of smoke where I started my career and worked with Dr. Greg Leptoukh, for whom this lecture is named, required a variety of datasets from satellite, surface observations and models.</description>
